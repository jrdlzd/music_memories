              I initially found this band back in 2021 with their single "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5AJ9oWWYzHvSJYX6IBEvMK?si=c429801294ba4e37" target="_blank">6AM</a>"". I didn't think much of this band until 2 years later where I came across the song "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7KWf7gZ05NciRE6SXZveds?si=b76c6f4bb0d5437f" target="_blank">Infinitely Falling</a>" when it was featured in a Netflix trailer for "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0kro6SuwxM&t=28s" target="_blank">Love at First Sight</a>".
              I was immediately captured by the song and decided to check out their album, and I was in for a ride. There are rarely any albums that I find that are "no-skips" and perfect front-to-back, this album is one of them. The opening track "In The Night" pulls you right in with it's 80s inspired saxophone riff and poppy drums, which are heard throughout the record, talks about the beautiful things between lovers. The ballad "What If I Wasn't Done Loving You?" explores lost love and heartbreak. "Different Lives" talks about how
               meeting a person can change one's entire perspective on life, for the better. The following track "Sometimes" is about trying to get over someone but sometimes, they still think about them. The penultimate closing track "Infinitely Falling" is the perfect song for that special person in your life. Overall, Fly By Midnight perfectly honed in on their song with top tier production and clever songwriting. It's the perfect mix of clever love songs and songs to lie and stare at the ceiling. This shows that Fly By Midnight is on the
               the rise and they are never going down.

              I found this band back in 2020 through a song they were featured called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2uVNn2pFpDlx1XrFcEfary?si=96b4184f067c49ff" target="_blank">Favorite Place by All Time Low</a>. Their feature was underutilized but their small presence on the song made me curious about their music. Then came their <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1N5ZRHDLAv92FHZ4fRYhCi?si=QBzjp7vKRcSnbSxTqyUPSw" target="_blank">self-titled debut album</a> and it got me hooked on their music. Three years and a <a href="project.html?id=2">second studio album</a> later, they returned with the Bruises EP. After their Fall 2023 tour, they felt disconnected and watered-down. So they went back to basics with this extended play, and basics they did. This EP is one of the best selections of music I have ever heard, and that's saying a lot. With only three songs, these songs are the most deep and heartfelt songs in their catalog. "Someone Who's Trying" talks about hoping to be given a second chance, showing that everyone is not perfect. The second track "Nostalgia" brings back the days of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6rbqqMTScIBxRBlM7DayP1?si=SNxbiRCERLajVb27zFjGVA" target="_blank">tryhard (2019)</a> with a soaring guitar riff and clever lyrics talking about the longing of past experiences; singing along to the tunes of "yesterdays". The title track of the EP "Bruises" is the one of the most vulnerable songs in the band's catalog that leaves you questioning "who hurt him?". Overall, The Band CAMINO definitely delivered with this three song EP, their heartfelt songwriting was missing from the past few projects, and they went back to basics and delivered what they did best. This EP shows that The Band CAMINO is still on the rise and they will be higher than they've ever been.

              I have little to no knowledge on this band other than that it's one of my friends' favorite bands and that they are from Florida. This extended play, front-to-back, is in-your-face, head-bopping rock goodness. It's all that you want in a modern rock album with punk influences. Zakk Giordano, the lead singer of NIGHTBREAKERS, seamlessly mashes with the pop-influenced with punk-strumming guitars and the guitar solos also have their moment on some of the songs. I can't say any more about this EP other than it's great and it's one of the best projects I've heard all year. This band clearly puts their heart and soul into each track, and left me wondering why they aren't much bigger?
