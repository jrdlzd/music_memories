        thoughts: 'This album was a very hard dive into pop rock territory from the band; also a very different direction for the band. Singles "Told You So", "What Am I Missing?", "Last Man In The World", and "See You Later" set the tone for the guitar heavy album, with the exception of "See You Later" demonstrating that the band can pull off a poppier song. This album felt like a watered-down version of the band, a band that I fell in love with for their thought-provoking lyrics and catchy melodies. This album just has lack-luster lyrics but still very catchy melodies. I still have a soft spot (and a fan bias) for this album in my heart, but I know they can do better',

        thoughts: 'With Jon Bellion as executive producer for this highly anticipated Jonas Brothers album, the brothers were taken to a completely new direction in their music. With country influences, this album was a breath of fresh air from their pop-filled predecessor record "Happiness Begins". This album sounds very authentic and something new from them, but I personally would not call this the album that defines them. Even with standouts such as "Vacation Eyes" and "Montana Sky", this short yet filled album still feels whole from a group who still has a long road ahead of them.',

        thoughts: 'As a huge fan of this band, I was eagerly excited by this album after their 2020 pandemic release "Wake Up, Sunshine" as I call it a "no-skips" album. The singles leading up to the album "Sleepwalking", "Tell Me I\'m Alive", and "Modern Love" left me skeptical as it was kind of different from their sound, yet still sounding \"All Time Low\". While blown away by the instrumentals and production by second time producer Zakk Cervini, I felt let down and it sounded like step-down from "Wake Up, Sunshine". While some standouts such as "New Religion" which featured singer Teddy Swims and "Are You There" (I believe this should\'ve been a single), all the rest has so much potential, but never reaches it. I know All Time Low can do better than this, they are still the same guys that wrote "Weightless" and "Somewhere in Neverland".',

I love the production and face lift Swank gave to these songs, with Alex's updated and mature vocals, the band defintely feels back, and they're here to do it, forever.",

This album creates a perfect blend of heavy rock with country elements while not overdoing the cliché banjo and twangy vocals.",

The rest of the extended play just felt like filler for the former singles so that they have some material out. I know they can do much better and this group has a bright future ahead.

        thoughts: 'I found this band unexpectedly through one of my other favorite bands "The Band CAMINO". I first fell in love with their single "Close To You", the lead single to their preceding album "Goodbye To All Of That, 2023", and have been following the band ever since. I had the lucky opportunity to see them live back in February 2024 where they surprise-performed an unreleased song "Wreck My Life", a heartfelt heaviness song about wishing that a person would leave before they fall back into the same cycle of hurt and regret. The Wldlfe then dropped singles "What If You Change?", "Turtleneck", and of course, "Wreck My Life", along with snippets of each track of the album leading up to its release. The 13 track record proves a statement that the band\'s journey is only beginnning. A wonderful mix of heavy, distorted guitars, trap beats, and pop melodies shows that The Wldlfe is continuing to evolve with each release.',

Moreover, the inclusion of some of my favorite bands such as Magnolia Park, Boys Like Girls, and Simple Plan had me looking forward for this cover album. However, this album kind of falls flat on some songs with the bands each just simply adding distorted guitar and drums and covering the song. It just doesn't feel like it lives up to the expectations I had. My personal favorite \"I2I\" from \"A Goofy Movie\", covered by Magnolia Park based in Orlando, Florida, perfectly captures magic of the 1995 classic with an updated and full sound. Other standout, \"Go the Distance\" from \"Hercules\", covered by We The Kings, was a much needed pop-punk treatment for the song and greatly executed by the band. Overall, this album was a lot of hits and misses with these well-known bands taking their own sound with these Disney classics.",

        thoughts: "Coming off of his debut album \"GABRIEL\" back in 2022, keshi returns with with a soulful sophomore album \"Requiem\". He leans further into the 80\'s pop territory with \"Say\" and \"Soft Spot\", showcasing his versatility and clear inspirations from one of his favorite artists, John Mayer with the flangy guitars in the background. He still shows that he is the same keshi from 2019-2020 with the infectious standout song, \"Like That\", and even including his producer tag in the song, a classic keshi moment. keshi still captures his dreamy and euphoric sound with this album while still enhancing his sound and expanding his discography. He definitely delivered with this album and avoided the \"sophomore slump\" curse that every artist may experience",

        thoughts: "I came across this small band through TikTok. They used to be a band named \"The 90s Kids\" but took a break for a few years but came back with this extended play because they missed creating music. These collection of songs are some of the best songs I've heard in a while. This project almost receives a perfect 10, but it left me wanting more at the end of the EP. I hopeful for the future of this band. There were some elements that I believe to be influenced by some of the leading indie rock artists such as Knox, Valley, and The Band CAMINO. If you a fan of any of these bands, you'll love this project.",

Honestly, each song has its own magic with tasty production and fabulous wordplay by Blxst, but this album did not need to be 20 songs (I say this jokingly, each song was very good). Hard hitters such as \"Dance With The Devil\" which featured Anderson .Paak and \"Rewind\" featured Feid and Becky G were among my favorites in the album. On the songs with Blxst alone, he was able to carry himself very well.",

I went into this album with really little to no expectations other than that Porter Robinson performed at my college and much of my friends like him. I was blown away by the synth melodies contrasting the very much depressive lyrics. This is a solid album and would like to see Porter Robinson lean into punk rock more because there is definitely influence in his music.",

However, this album proved me wrong. His true passion is creating music and it is shown in each of his albums so far. This album contrasts the previous album \"Hell Or Highwater\" with him returning to heavier tones and guitar-driven tracks. This album shows that his true passion is creating, and that quality will get higher the more he creates.",

        thoughts: "I honestly went into this album blindly, while expecting some usual K-pop tunes. When the album ended on \"Melody\", I was left thinking \"What did I just listen to?\". Don\'t get me wrong, this was a solid album to showcase the group's versatility, but almost too versatile. Some songs felt too cheesy like \"BAHAMA\" or \"Licorice\". These songs strayed away from the seriousness that were the first three tracks: \"Supernova\", \"Armageddon\", and \"Set The Tone\". I thought for sure after these three songs I was expecting a fierce and powerful remaining songs. But I was wrong. Tracks four through seven made me question if I was listening to the same album, or somebody's Spotify playlist. Nevertheless, \"Prologue\", \"Live My Life\" and \"Melody\" saved the album in my opinion, but those last few songs didn't feel like they belonged on the same album as the previous seven tracks. Overall, this album was confusing. It felt like these songs were put together by their management to find the most songs that could attract any crowd. It's great to expand ones' discography, but in the end, this is one of the albums of all time.",
